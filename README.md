# Sudoku Solver

by Arthur Kim

When i was on a united plain, A gentleman beside me was solving a sudoku puzzle.
Suddenly, I wondered that do i solve all of sudoku puzzles including a hard one.
By the way, what is the difference between a hard problem and an intermeidate problem.
I decided to proof that all of my tactics can solve any sudoku puzzles.
So I borrowed a sudoku book from a gentleman, 
I made a simple program which has all my tactic to solve a puzzle.
 
and my tactics was...

1. find all rows and columns which has only one missing number.
2. find all small sqares which has only one missing number.
3. loop 1-2 until when puzzle is solved.

the result was that....it can only solve easier than intermediate.
it can't solve even the medium level though.
Still I don't know what are hidden strategies.
